# Fraud-Detection
This project is all about spotting fraudulent financial transactions using Python and data analysis. We worked with a real-world credit card transaction dataset, which includes both normal and fraudulent activities. Each transaction comes with anonymized features (named V1 to V28), the transaction amount, time, and a label showing whether it was fraud or not. The goal was to find patterns that can help us tell the difference between genuine and suspicious transactions.

We started by cleaning the data—checking for missing values, scaling the numbers so they're easier to work with, and handling any extreme values that might throw off the analysis. Then we explored the data visually using graphs to see how different features behave in fraud vs. non-fraud cases. We found that some features like V1, V3, V10, and V11 show very different patterns when fraud is involved, which is super helpful for building a detection model.

Even though building a full machine learning model wasn’t the main focus here, this project lays the groundwork for doing that next. Tools like Logistic Regression or Random Forest could be used to predict fraud based on the patterns we found. We also looked into using Power BI to create visual dashboards, making it easier to see trends and explain the findings. In short, this project gives a solid starting point for creating smarter fraud detection systems using data.
 
HOW TO RUN:
 
Install Requirements
  .Python (version 3.8+)
  .Required libraries:
     pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, jupyter
     
Install via:
  pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn jupyter

Download Dataset
 Source: Kaggle – Credit Card Fraud Detection
 File: creditcard.csv
 Save it in your project folder
 
Launch Jupyter Notebook
  .Run: jupyter notebook in terminal or command prompt
  .Create a new notebook (e.g., Fraud_Detection.ipynb)
  
Load the Data
  .Use pandas to read the dataset:
    import pandas as pd
    df = pd.read_csv("creditcard.csv")
    df.head()
    
Clean and Preprocess
  .Check for missing values
  .Scale Amount and Time:
   from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
   df['Amount_scaled'] = StandardScaler().fit_transform(df[['Amount']])
   df['Time_scaled'] = StandardScaler().fit_transform(df[['Time']])
   
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   .Class balance:
    sns.countplot(x='Class', data=df)
    KDE or distribution plots for features like V1, V3, V10, V11

Build a Model
  .Use train_test_split, RandomForestClassifier, etc.

Evaluate with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score


Export CSV:
  .df.to_csv("processed_data.csv", index=False)
Import into Power BI and create visuals (e.g., fraud trends, feature analysis)










 Outcome:
This project lays the foundation for a robust fraud detection system, helping financial institutions identify high-risk transactions and reduce financial losses. The combination of EDA, visualization, and machine learning creates a powerful data-driven solution for real-time fraud prevention.
